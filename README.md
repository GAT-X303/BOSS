# BOSS - Badminton Open Source System

## Introduction
Badminton can be costly to play with the ever growing cost of equipment. However, it is also important to train fundamentals through drilling. This can be hard for people who lack skilled training partners and most resort to coaching. Coaching itself can be expensive and at time it can be more productive to work on other skills instead of basic shots. BOSS aims to fix this by providing an open source badminton feeding system that will help those who cannot afford it, or those who choose not to.

WILL BE UPDATED AFTER APRIL (EXAMS)
